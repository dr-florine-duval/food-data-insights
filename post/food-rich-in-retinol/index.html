                <p><strong>Vitamin A: Going Straight to the Source</strong></p>

<p>When you search for foods high in vitamin A, most lists lump together different forms of the vitamin&mdash;mainly <strong>retinol</strong> (preformed vitamin A) and <strong>beta-carotene</strong> (a provitamin A carotenoid). That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll often see carrots on those lists. Carrots are indeed rich in beta-carotene, but beta-carotene has to be converted into retinol before your body can use it. The conversion isn&rsquo;t 100% efficient, and it can vary between individuals.</p>

<p>If you want to go straight to the most bioavailable form&mdash;<strong>retinol itself</strong>&mdash;animal-derived foods are the direct source.</p>

<p>To get a clearer picture, I pulled data from the USDA FoodData Central database. Out of more than 6,000 foods with retinol values, I ranked them from highest to lowest and selected the top 30. To keep the list practical and relevant, I:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Chose only one version of each food (for example, raw beef liver but not also the cooked version)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Left out fortified and processed items with added retinol</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The result? A curated lineup of whole foods naturally rich in retinol&mdash;ready for your body to absorb and use immediately.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the interactive horizontal bar chart with those 30 foods. Have a look, hover over each bar for details, and see which ones surprise you!</p>
