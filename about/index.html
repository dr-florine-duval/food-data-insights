    <h2>About Food Data Insights</h2>



    <section style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; padding: 1rem;">

  <p>
    Nutrition can be surprisingly tricky. You decide you need more protein, less sugar, more vitamin C, or fewer carbs —
    but then comes the real challenge: <strong>what exactly do you eat?</strong> Among the countless fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains,
    which ones actually meet your goals?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s say you’re looking for foods high in vitamin C. A quick search gives you a list… but it doesn’t tell you which of those
    are also low in sugar, which might be equally important to you. Or maybe you’re focused on fats — aiming for more saturated fats
    and fewer polyunsaturated fats — and you want to compare your options. Or perhaps you’re chasing vitamin A, but not the plant-based
    beta-carotene you see everywhere; you want retinol, the active form your body can readily use.
  </p>

  <p>
    These kinds of specific, practical questions often don’t have simple answers in typical nutrition resources.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 1.5em;">What I Do Here</h2>

  <p>
    That’s where <strong>Food Data Insights</strong> comes in. Using the USDA food database as my starting point,
    I create interactive data visualizations that let you explore nutrient information in ways that standard lists simply can’t match.
  </p>

  <p>
    With these tools, you can:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.2em;">
    <li>Compare foods not just by a single nutrient, but by combinations or ratios (e.g., vitamin C per 100 grams of sugar).</li>
    <li>Explore nutrient differences across similar foods (like different cuts of meat or varieties of fruit).</li>
    <li>See how preparation methods — raw, boiled, roasted — change nutrient content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Every post here features an interactive <em>Plotly</em> chart you can explore yourself. The goal is simple:
    give you clear, flexible insights so you can make food choices that truly match your priorities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you’re a nutrition professional, a data enthusiast, or just someone curious about what’s on your plate,
    I think you’ll find plenty here to explore — and maybe even a few surprises.
